# My-Money
Feel your money!

## Concept
The idea is to get the list of expenses from the SMS every time you make a transaction and analyse your expenses on a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly basis. You can see a list of all your transactions in one place, see the total amount spent each day, week, month, and year. Track loans that you have received or lent to others. You can also set due date alarms. Save all the bills in one single place. You can create collections of bills by taking a picture and even print the bills when necessary. You can also share them in PDF format. This will also have Loan tracking and receipt/bill collection. Everything money related will be in this single App. I will delelte My Loans and My Bills. I dont have patience to do so many things.
